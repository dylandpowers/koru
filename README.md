# koru
A web application for Koru meditation. Find the site [here](www.korumeditation.com).

This website is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), and is hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

The frontend uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for css-in-js styling.
It also uses [Redux thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk), a really neat library for dispatching asynchronous actions in Redux.
